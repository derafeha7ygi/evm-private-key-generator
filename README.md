# evm-private-key-generator
**Simple and secure EVM wallet key generator designed for rapid onboarding and Web3 application development.**

A secure and simple tool for generating private keys and addresses for EVM-compatible blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.). This project is intended solely for educational, testing, and research purposes.

**⚙️ How it works:**

*·A random 256-bit number is generated.*

*·This number is used as a private key.*

*·The public key is calculated from the private key.*

*·The EVM address is formed from the public key.*
